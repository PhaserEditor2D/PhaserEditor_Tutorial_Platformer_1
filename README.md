![banner](https://github.com/boniatillo-com/PhaserEditor_Tutorial_Platformer_1/raw/master/banner.png)

This repo contains the assets and source code of the tutorial published in Zenva GameDev Academy [missing ref].

[Play the final demo](http://phasereditor.boniatillo.com/demos/zenva-tuto-platformer-1/final-demo/)

In that tutorial we cover:

- Project setup
- Assets loading
- Scene making with the visual scene builder
- Physics setup
- Player controls
- Player animations
- Coins collecting

In the Projects folder there are several projects that allow you to start an any section in the tutorial or see the expected results of a section.

To test the projects you don't need Phaser Editor, you can start a local web server and open the `<project>/WebContent/index.html` file of each project. However, we recommend you to download Phaser Editor do the tasks step by step. To import the projects in Phaser Editor use the **Import > Existing projects into workspace wizard**, just select the **Copy projects into workspace** option.

Enjoy it!
